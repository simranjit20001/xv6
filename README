XV6 Operating System Enhancement Project
Description
This project aims to enhance the XV6 operating system by implementing new features, improving existing functionalities, and optimizing performance. The XV6 operating system is a simple, Unix-like teaching operating system developed for educational purposes.

Features Implemented
System Calls Addition:

Implemented new system calls in XV6, including dup2() and custom calls like sys_date() for getting the current date.

Process Scheduler:

Improved process scheduling by implementing a priority-based scheduler using circular buffers.
Prioritized processes based on their priority levels (high and low priority queues).
Enhanced the scheduling algorithm to select processes based on priority and round-robin.
